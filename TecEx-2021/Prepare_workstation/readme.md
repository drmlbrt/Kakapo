#prepare workstation

I prepared a small bash script that automates the download of desperately needed packages.
The fear of missing out can be a pain. 

##How to?

Open terminal,
Create a file with 'nano' or 'gedit'.
Nano or gedit are my two favorite text editors

`sudo gedit prepareworkstation.sh`

copy and paste the contents of the git file in it.
Then change the local user rights on the file.

`sudo chmod +x prepareworkstation.sh`

then run the script:

`sudo bash prepareworkstation.sh`

Let it be.
In the end all needed packages are installed, and it saves you a lot of time.
